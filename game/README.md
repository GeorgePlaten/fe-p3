##How to play

If you can avoid the speeding ladybugs, you'll live.
But if you jump in the water, you won't.

You're safe on the grass, but you won't score there.
Your **arrow keys** will get you to where you _can_.

You can score BIG, if you can capture a gem.
But that'll make the ladybugs a little bit mad.
